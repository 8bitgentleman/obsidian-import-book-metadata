# Book Metadata importer

This is a small plugin to find and import book metadata from the Open Library Database. 

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

This sample plugin demonstrates some of the basic functionality the plugin API can do.
- Adds a ribbon icon, which shows a Notice when clicked.
- Adds a command "Open Sample Modal" which opens a Modal.
- Adds a plugin setting tab to the settings page.
- Registers a global click event and output 'click' to the console.
- Registers a global interval which logs 'setInterval' to the console.

## How to use

- Install the plugin
- Create a file for a book in a 'Book' directory. (ie `[[Book/Thinking Fast and Slow]]` this may change)
- Open the book file and run the slash command `Import Book Metadata`
- Select the correct book from the list 
- Watch as metadata for the book is added to your file
